                                          AN MACHINE LEARNING AND BLOCKCHAIN WITH OPTIMAL MINER SELECTION FOR RELIABLE DDOS ATTACK DETECTION

Description

This project proposes a novel framework that integrates Federated Machine Learning with Blockchain technology to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks reliably. The framework addresses the vulnerabilities of blockchain networks to DDoS attacks by leveraging distributed machine learning and a dynamic reputation-based miner selection mechanism. The proposed method ensures high accuracy in attack detection and enhances the security of the blockchain against various attacks, including DDoS and 51% attacks.

Methodology





Federated Machine Learning: Enables distributed training of machine learning models to detect DDoS attacks without centralizing sensitive data.



Blockchain Integration: Stores machine learning models on the blockchain to prevent poisoning attacks by malicious nodes.



Reputation-based Miner Selection: A dynamic mechanism that selects miners based on their reputation, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure model accuracy and blockchain security.

Results

The framework was tested using Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Regression algorithms. It achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.1% with the Random Forest model, outperforming existing DDoS detection mechanisms.
